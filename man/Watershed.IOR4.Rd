\title{
Watershed inlet and outlet nodes: case 4
}
\description{
The function determines the inlet and outlet nodes for \code{zhyd} watershed objects. This case 4 is for those watersheds that its river inlet and outlet object is length 4 (length(riverIO)=4).
}
\usage{
Watershed.IOR4(x, y, dist)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
An object \code{"SpatialPointsDataFrame"} as is described in package \code{sp} over them the function will search the inlet and outlet nodes of the watershed.
}
  \item{y}{
An object \code{"SpatialLinesDataFrame"} as is described in package \code{sp} that  represents the inlet and outlet rivers of the watershed.
}
  \item{dist}{
A vector with the distances of each point in \code{x} to the current {zhyd} boundary.
}
