Creation and handling of objects class \code{Watershed} for identifying the subbasin that contains the current \code{station} (class \code{SpatialPoints}) and subsets the \code{zhyd} object to subbasin and extract the current \code{zhy} object that contains \code{station} via the S4 method \code{Watershed.Order}. Identification of the inlet and outlet stretches and inlet and outlet nodes of the \code{zhyd}. Implementation of functions \code{Watershed. ,IOR1, IOR2, IOR3}, and \code{IOR4} for determining the actual inlet and outlet nodes.  S4 methods \code{Watershed.Order2} and \code{Watershed.Tributary} for defining tributary nodes and tributary catchments of the current \code{zhyd} watershed.
