  abstract = {The current popularity of the rainfall-runoff model Topmodel is a
	direct result of the widespread availability of catchment GIS systems
	and particularly of digital terrain maps. Water flows downhill, therefore
	topography must be hydrologically significant, therefore how can
	the digital terrain data be used in hydrological modelling to improve
	the realism of the predictions? There are not many choices available:
	Topmodel is one of them but the concepts on which it is based will
	not be applicable everywhere (see some of the papers in this volume).
	Indeed, one of the most important aspects of the use of Topmodel
	is the possibility of mapping the simulations back into space so
	that the distributed predictions can be compared with field observations.
	The experiences reported here in applications from around the world
	represent an excellent summary of the success and limitations of
	the concepts in a wide variety of environments. Topmodel was never
	intended to be a fixed model structure but rather a set of concepts
	that could be modified if required. As such it is important that
	the experiences of other uses can be gathered together and passed
	on.},

	Review of mathematical bases}},
  journal = {Transactions of the ASAE},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {46},
  pages = {1553-1566()},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {A clear understanding of a model is important for its appropriate
	use. In this article, eleven watershed scale hydrologic and nonpoint-source
	pollution models are reviewed: AGNPS, AnnAGNPS, ANSWERS, ANSWERS-Continuous,
	CASC2D, DWSM, HSPF, KINEROS, MIKE SHE, PRMS, and SWAT. AnnAGNPS,
	ANSWERS-Continuous, HSPF, and SWAT are continuous simulation models
	useful for analyzing long-term effects of hydrological changes and
	watershed management practices, especially agricultural practices.
	AGNPS, ANSWERS, DWSM, and KINEROS are single rainfall event models
	useful for analyzing severe actual or design single-event storms
	and evaluating watershed management practices, especially structural
	practices. CASC2D, MIKE SHE, and PRMS have both long-term and single-event
	simulation capabilities. Mathematical bases, the most important and
	critical elements of these mathematical models, were identified and
	compiled. In this article, a comprehensive summary of the compilation
	is presented in tabular form. The flow-governing equations and their
	solution methods used in each of the eleven models are discussed.
	The compilation of the mathematical bases of these models would be
	useful to determine the problems, situations, or conditions for which
	the models are most suitable, the accuracies and uncertainties expected,
	their full potential uses and limitations, and directions for their
	enhancements or new developments. AGNPS, AnnAGNPS, DWSM, HSPF, MIKE
	SHE, and SWAT were found to have all the three major components (hydrology,
	sediment, and chemical) applicable to watershed-scale catchments.
	SWAT is a promising model for continuous simulations in predominantly
	agricultural watersheds, and HSPF is promising for mixed agricultural
	and urban watersheds. Among the single-event models, DWSM provides
	a balance between the simple but approximate and the computationally
	intensive models and, therefore, is a promising storm event model
	for agricultural watersheds.},

  abstract = {Knowing the travel-time distributions from infiltrating rivers to
	pumping wells is important in the management of alluvial aquifers.
	Commonly, travel-time distributions are determined by releasing a
	tracer pulse into the river and measuring the breakthrough curve
	in the wells. As an alternative, one may measure signals of a time-varying
	natural tracer in the river and in adjacent wells and infer the travel-time
	distributions by deconvolution. Traditionally this is done by fitting
	a parametric function such as the solution of the one-dimensional
	advection-dispersion equation to the data. By choosing a certain
	parameterization, it is impossible to determine features of the travel-time
	distribution that do not follow the general shape of the parameterization,
	i.e., multiple peaks. We present a method to determine travel-time
	distributions by nonparametric deconvolution of electric-conductivity
	time series. Smoothness of the inferred transfer function is achieved
	by a geostatistical approach, in which the transfer function is assumed
	as a second-order intrinsic random time variable. Nonnegativity is
	enforced by the method of Lagrange multipliers. We present an approach
	to directly compute the best nonnegative estimate and to generate
	sets of plausible solutions. We show how the smoothness of the transfer
	function can be estimated from the data. The approach is applied
	to electric-conductivity measurements taken at River Thur, Switzerland,
	and five wells in the adjacent aquifer, but the method can also be
	applied to other time-varying natural tracers such as temperature.
	At our field site, electric-conductivity fluctuations appear to be
	an excellent natural tracer.},

	models are applied to solve hydrological problems, and some of the
	many available models are classified into four main groups. It is
	suggested that models with parameters estimated by computing the
	minimum of a least-squares objective function represent an application
	of well-known non-linear regression theory to situations in which
	the assumptions commonly made in this theory are seldom valid. The
	correction required is not the use of objective functions other than
	those based on sums of squares, but the use of more realistic assumptions
	concerning the stochastic structure of the model residuals. Interdependence
	between model parameters necessitates extensive exploration of the
	sum-of-squares surface in the neighbourhood of its minimum even when
	regression assumptions are valid: this is particularly true where
	the model is to be used to examine the likely effects of a proposed
	physical change to the catchment, since the complexity of such a
	change will not generally be represented by a change in one (or even
	some) of the model's parameters, regardless of the remainder.},

  abstract = {Introduction
	
	The integrative biological and geoscientific examination of both the
	nature of physical
	
	and biotic environments which make up ecosystems, and the interactions
	between these
	
	sub-systems, has substantiated the conception that a thorough knowledge
	of the
	
	ecosystem and its unifying position between ecology and environmental
	science is
	
	essential for a coherent understanding of environmental issues and
	large-scale problems
	
	in the biosphere. Recent developments in ecosystem theory have created
	a challenge to
	
	the development of recipes for a sustainable management of ecosystems
	and regions. It
	
	is increasingly considered in the disciplines of conservation biology,
	in the assessment
	
	of ecosystem health, integrity and sustainability, in ecological engineering,
	and in
	
	ecological economics in order to solve practical environmental management
	problems.
	
	In all of these fields modelling plays an essential role, since models
	provide for
	
	opportunities to develop strong transdisciplinary ties between the
	ecological community
	
	and the agency management personnel. A wide variety of illustrative
	examples of such
	
	approaches is provided by the International Biological Programme (IBP)
	and, in particular,
	
	by UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) which, together
	with the
	
	German concept of a comprehensive ecological surveillance system (Ellenberg
	et al.
	
	1978), contributed to define the concept and structure of the Bornhöved
	Project. They
	
	are summarized in the first part of the present Chapter while, in
	a concise form, the second
	
	part provides information about the practices, procedures and instrumentation
	used
	
	when implementing the ecosystem research scheme in the Bornhöved Lake

  abstract = {In this paper, the self-organizing map (SOM) is applied to identify
	the homogeneous regions for regional frequency analysis. First, the
	algorithm and structure of the \{SOM\} are presented. Then the experimental
	design is applied to test the cluster accuracy of the SOM, the K-means
	method and Ward's method. These three clustering methods are tested
	on experimental data sets where the amount of cluster dispersion
	and the cluster membership are controlled and known. Among the three
	clustering methods, the results show that the \{SOM\} determines
	the cluster membership more accurately than the K-means method and
	Ward's method. Finally, the \{SOM\} is applied to actual rainfall
	data in Taiwan to identify homogeneous regions for regional frequency
	analysis. A two-dimensional map indicates that the rain gauges can
	be grouped into eight clusters. A heterogeneity test indicates that
	the eight regions are sufficiently homogeneous. Moreover, the results
	show that the \{SOM\} can identify the homogeneous regions more accurately
	as compared to the other two clustering methods. Because of unsupervised
	learning, the \{SOM\} does not require the knowledge of corresponding
	output for comparison purposes. In addition, the \{SOM\} is more
	robust than the traditional clustering methods. Therefore, the \{SOM\}
	is recommended as an alternative to the identification of homogeneous
	regions for regional frequency analysis.},

  abstract = {Introduction
	
	The integrative biological and geoscientific examination of both the
	nature of physical
	
	and biotic environments which make up ecosystems, and the interactions
	between these
	
	sub-systems, has substantiated the conception that a thorough knowledge
	of the
	
	ecosystem and its unifying position between ecology and environmental
	science is
	
	essential for a coherent understanding of environmental issues and
	large-scale problems
	
	in the biosphere. Recent developments in ecosystem theory have created
	a challenge to
	
	the development of recipes for a sustainable management of ecosystems
	and regions. It
	
	is increasingly considered in the disciplines of conservation biology,
	in the assessment
	
	of ecosystem health, integrity and sustainability, in ecological engineering,
	and in
	
	ecological economics in order to solve practical environmental management
	problems.
	
	In all of these fields modelling plays an essential role, since models
	provide for
	
	opportunities to develop strong transdisciplinary ties between the
	ecological community
	
	and the agency management personnel. A wide variety of illustrative
	examples of such
	
	approaches is provided by the International Biological Programme (IBP)
	and, in particular,
	
	by UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) which, together
	with the
	
	German concept of a comprehensive ecological surveillance system (Ellenberg
	et al.
	
	1978), contributed to define the concept and structure of the Bornhöved
	Project. They
	
	are summarized in the first part of the present Chapter while, in
	a concise form, the second
	
	part provides information about the practices, procedures and instrumentation
	used
	
	when implementing the ecosystem research scheme in the Bornhöved Lake
	District.},

  pages = {241-254},
  abstract = {An exploratory analysis on the variability of flood
	
	occurrence rates in 10 Portuguese watersheds is made, to ascertain
	
	if that variability is concurrent with the principle of
	
	stationarity. A peaks-over-threshold (POT) sampling technique
	
	is applied to 10 long series of mean daily streamflows
	
	and to 4 long series of daily rainfall in order to sample
	
	the times of occurrence (POT time data) of the peak values
	
	of those series. The kernel occurrence rate estimator, coupled
	
	with a bootstrap approach, was applied to the POT time
	
	data to obtain the time dependent estimated occurrence rate
	
	curves, ˆ(t), of floods and extreme rainfall events. The results
	
	of the analysis show that the occurrence of those events
	
	constitutes an inhomogeneous Poisson process, hence the occurrence
	
	rates are nonstationary. An attempt was made to
	
	assess whether the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) casted
	
	any influence on the occurrence rate of floods in the study
	
	area. Although further research is warranted, it was found
	
	that years with a less-than-average occurrence of floods tend
	
	to occur when the winter NAO is in the positive phase, and
	
	years with a higher occurrence of floods (more than twice the
	
	average) tend to occur when the winter NAO is in the negative
	
	phase. Although the number of analyzed watersheds and
	
	their uneven spatial distribution hinders the generalization of
	
	the findings to the country scale, the authors conclude that the
	
	mathematical formulation of the flood frequency models relying
	
	on stationarity commonly employed in Portugal should
	
	be revised in order to account for possible nonstationarities
	
	in the occurrence rates of such events.},
